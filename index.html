                What allows me to deeply dive into intuitive understanding of complex matters is complete removal of distractions in
                form of sensory input, physical discomfort, interfering thoughts and emotions. This can be conveniently achieved in flow
                state, which can be easly initiated with means of synchronizing lightweight semi-repetitive physical activity with corresponding
                music. Historically it was achieved in trance dancing, martial art, yoga practice and sex, bike+music player seams most convenient nowadays.

                Since i create conscious memories my main area of interest is spontaneous interaction of elements in complex system.
                In my childhood years it manifested mainly as observation of fire, ants, clouds and trees. Gradually i realized presence
                of similar patterns in human artifacts and behavior. Subsequently it appeared to me that those rules bind also elements
                of macrocosm and microcosm. Internet fascinated me when for first time i was able to put my hands on it, ultimately because
                it is most easly available and characterized by minimum latency, representation of phenomena fascinating me.

                I consider treating any element of system as independent entity as delusion of weak minded anthropocentrists.
                Not realizing that independent element can't interact and in effect have any weight in interaction matrix,
                subsequently becoming negligible makes actor negligible to me.

            A free market does not require the existence of competition, however it does require a framework that allows new market entrants.
            Hence, in the lack of coercive barriers, for example, paid licensing certification for certain services and businesses,
            competition between businesses flourishes all through the demands of consumers, or buyers.
            It often suggests the presence of the profit motive, although neither a profit motive or profit itself are necessary for a free market.
            All modern free markets are understood to include entrepreneurs, both individuals and businesses. Typically,
            a modern free-market economy would include other features such as a stock exchange and a financial services sector, but they do not define it.
